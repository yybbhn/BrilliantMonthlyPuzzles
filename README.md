# STATED PROBLEM:
Congratulations! You won free one-way tickets for life on Somewhere Air. The only problem? Each trip, your destination is chosen at random. Somewhere Air has service to 25 cities, including yours. Each city has direct flights to every other city. Once you begin  jet-setting, what's the average number of flights youâ€™ll take before you get back home?

My solution, detailed and plotted in the Python file, is also explained on their page, linked below, where I am shouted out for being the first to get the solution correctly.
